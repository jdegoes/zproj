**Parallel workspaces with bare git worktrees and tmux.**

Manage parallel feature branches as first-class workspaces. Each branch gets
its own directory and a tmux window with a 3-pane layout — coding agent,
editor, and shell — all opened in the right place automatically. Worktrees,
branches, and windows are created and torn down together as a unit.

A built-in review workflow lets you annotate lines during a diff review and
dispatch the collected notes to your coding agent for implementation.

`zproj integrate` bootstraps a new machine in one command: installs `ck` and
`cqs` code search tools, copies bundled skill files into your coding agent's
global skills directory, and asks your agent to wire up your editor.

## Requirements

| Tool | Version | Purpose |
|------|---------|---------|
| bash | 3.2+ | Runtime (bash 4+ preferred) |
| git | 2.5+ | Worktree support |
| tmux | 3.0+ | Named pane support |

One of the following coding agents is auto-discovered (or set `$CODING_AGENT`):  
`opencode`, `claude`, `codex`, `amp`, `aider`, `goose`, `gemini`, `agent` (Cursor)

> **Cursor CLI Agent:** In repositories containing `.cursor/`, `.cursorrules`,
> or `.cursorignore`, the Cursor CLI agent (`agent`) is automatically preferred
> over the default discovery order.

One of the following editors is auto-discovered (or set `$ZPROJ_EDITOR`):  
`$EDITOR`, `nvim`, `vim`

**Optional** (used by `zproj integrate` to install tools):

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| cargo | Install `ck` and `cqs` (preferred) |
| npm | Install `ck` if cargo is absent |

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repo (required — zproj needs the bundled skills/ directory)
git clone https://github.com/jdegoes/zproj ~/Documents/git/zproj

# Symlink the script into your PATH
ln -s ~/Documents/git/zproj/main/zproj ~/.local/bin/zproj

# Verify
zproj --version
```

> **Note:** Clone the repo rather than copying the script. The `skills/` and
> `rules/` directories next to the script are needed for `zproj integrate` to
> install skill files, rules, and tools. A standalone script copy will warn
> gracefully but cannot install skills or rules.

## Quick start

```bash
# Start a new project
zproj init my-project
cd my-project
zproj                        # opens tmux session with main worktree

# Clone an existing repo
zproj clone git@github.com:you/my-project.git
cd my-project
zproj

# Work on a feature
zproj feature-auth           # creates worktree + branch + tmux window
zproj delete feature-auth    # tears it all down when done
```

## How it works

### Directory structure

`zproj init` or `zproj clone` creates a bare repo with one worktree per branch:

```
my-project/
  .bare/              bare git repository
  .git                pointer: "gitdir: ./.bare"
  main/               worktree for the main branch
  feature-auth/       worktree for feature-auth branch
  fix-bug/            worktree for fix-bug branch
```

Each worktree directory is a fully independent working tree. You can have
multiple branches open simultaneously without stashing or switching.

### Tmux layout

One tmux **session** per project, one **window** per worktree. Each window has
three panes, all opened in the worktree directory:

```
┌─────────────────┬──────────────────┐
│                 │                  │
│  coding agent   │     editor       │
│  (pane 1)       │     (pane 2)     │
│                 ├──────────────────┤
│                 │                  │
│                 │     shell        │
│                 │     (pane 3)     │
└─────────────────┴──────────────────┘
```

Panes are named after the tool they run (e.g. `opencode`, `nvim`, `shell`)
so dispatch commands always reach the right pane regardless of which window
is active.

### Tool resolution

```bash
zproj --env          # show which editor and agent will be used
zproj --diagnostics  # check the full environment for problems
```

| Env var | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `CODING_AGENT` | Override coding agent (e.g. `export CODING_AGENT=claude`) |
| `ZPROJ_EDITOR` | Override editor (e.g. `export ZPROJ_EDITOR=nvim`) |

## Review workflow

During development, annotate lines of interest while reviewing a diff. Notes
accumulate in `.agents/plans/review-notes.md` inside the worktree. When ready,
dispatch all notes to the coding agent in one step.

```bash
zproj review path      # print the notes file path
zproj review view      # display accumulated notes
zproj review dispatch  # send notes to coding agent, delete file
zproj review clear     # discard notes
```

The dispatch command assembles a prompt from the notes, saves it to a temp
file, and sends a one-line handoff message to the coding agent pane via tmux.
The notes file is deleted after the temp file is safely written.

## Machine integration

`zproj integrate` bootstraps a new machine in one step:

1. **Installs `ck`** — semantic code search (`cargo install ck-search`, or
   `npm install -g @beaconbay/ck-search` if cargo is absent)
2. **Installs `cqs`** — code intelligence and call graph analysis
   (`cargo install cqs`)
3. **Copies skill files** from `skills/*/SKILL.md` in the zproj repo into
   your coding agent's global skills directory (e.g.
   `~/.config/opencode/skills/` for OpenCode)
4. **Installs instruction rules** from `rules/*.md` in the zproj repo into
   the agent's global instructions file (e.g.
   `~/.config/opencode/AGENTS.md` for OpenCode)
5. **Asks your coding agent** to implement the review workflow in your editor
   (add note / view / dispatch / clear), using the Neovim reference
   implementation as a concrete example

```bash
zproj integrate                      # full bootstrap
zproj integrate --skills-only        # install tools + skills, skip editor
zproj integrate --plan               # dry run: show what would be done
zproj integrate --skills-only --plan # dry run: tools + skills only
```

Skills directory per agent:

| Agent          | Global skills directory |
|----------------|-------------------------|
| opencode       | `~/.config/opencode/skills/` |
| claude         | `~/.claude/skills/` |
| codex          | `~/.agents/skills/` |
| amp            | `~/.config/agents/skills/` |
| agent (Cursor) | `~/.cursor/skills/` |

### Bundled skills

The `skills/` directory in this repo contains skill files for:

- **`ck`** — semantic code search; replaces grep/rg for source files
- **`cqs`** — call graphs, impact analysis, refactoring safety, dead code

Add a `skills/<toolname>/SKILL.md` to the repo and it will be installed
automatically on the next `zproj integrate` run.

### Bundled rules

The `rules/` directory contains instruction rules installed into the agent's
global instructions file. Each rule is a Markdown file with YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
marker: "stable substring for idempotent detection"
---
The rule text appended to the instructions file.
```

The `marker:` field is a stable substring used to detect whether the rule is
already present — so the rule is never duplicated even if the user edits the
file. Add a `rules/<name>.md` to the repo and it will be installed
automatically on the next `zproj integrate` run.
